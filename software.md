# Hello fruit code

The Hello Fruit code consists on a single Jupyter Notebook. It loads a CSV file named [sample.csv](https://github.com/BioSchemas/github-markup-example/blob/main/data/sample.csv) and creates a hello message from its rows, based on the seconds corresponding to the current time.

For a description of the sample.CSV file, visit the [data page](./data.md).
