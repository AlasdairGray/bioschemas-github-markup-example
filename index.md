# Welcome to Hello Fruit, a Bioschemas markup example on GitHub pages

All branches (main, gh-pages, gh-pages-with-markup) in this repository are created to show how to use Bioschemas markup on GitHub pages, following two approaches:
1. Adding markup directly to a page
2. Using a layout for a specifc type of page and then adding the corresponding markup for it

So far it is not intended to be used on its onw but as part of a Bioschemas tutorial. The branches are described as follows:
* main has dome dummy code in a Jupyter Notebook that loads a CSV and creates a hello message from one of the rows
* gh-pages is this branch and fluctuates between gh-pages-basic and gh-pages-with-markup 
* gh-pages-basic is a branch with no markup at all
* gh-pages-with-markup is the branch where the Bioschemas markup is applied and used
